The end





<!-- bugs to fix after app has been completed--> solutions
reduce scroll bar size drop downs and modals
stopping people for booking on days and times that have already been booked - (send a list of disabled times for a date, drop down will contain array of objects with disabled properties)




page transitions with the line increased width thingy - (i have a repo saved)
blocking periods for days
making the application look finer on smaller screens
stopping people from booking dates and times that have already been approved
making additions to the calender to block blur out dates that have been blocked.
Adding react spring transitions to the application (the cards will be loaded that way. the side bar will move with react spring).
reduce fonts sizes  throughout the apps on smaller screens.
makes the modals wider on small screens.
catch internet errors, design a page for 404 screen.
